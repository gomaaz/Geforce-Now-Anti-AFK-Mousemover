# üéÆ GeForce NOW Anti-AFK Script (AutoHotkey v1)

This script prevents **GeForce NOW** from logging you out due to inactivity.  
It simulates small mouse movements **in the background**, without changing your actual cursor position or interfering with your game.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Works **entirely in the background** (no window focus required)  
- Uses **PostMessage** for native background input  
- No visible mouse movement or window switching  
- Customizable interval between actions  
- Available as both `.ahk` (source) and `.exe` (standalone)  

---

## How it works

- The script uses AutoHotkey‚Äôs PostMessage function to send WM_MOUSEMOVE messages directly to the GeForceNOW.exe window.
- These messages are interpreted by GeForce NOW as real user activity ‚Äî even though no visible mouse motion happens.

---

## üß© Requirements

- For the `.ahk` version: [AutoHotkey v1.x](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/1.1/) (‚ö†Ô∏è not v2!)  
- For the `.exe` version: **no installation required** ‚Äî just run it directly  
- GeForce NOW must be running

my := 5                 ; Starting Y position
